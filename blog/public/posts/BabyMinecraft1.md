## Inspiration
I always viewed Minecraft as one of the greatest video games created (and I think it will stay that way for a while). Minecraft also has some really interesting problems to be solved which is why I decided to create a basic prototype in OpenGL (also to learn more about graphics programming in general). I want to improve upon this prototype in the future and add more blocks, block placement/deletion, better terrain generation, and lighting.

## Features
This version has:
1. Infinite terrain generation with noise
2. Smart chunking and meshing to increase draw call speed
3. Texture atlas to support hundreds of textures and block types

## The Code
You can view the github repository for this basic ray tracer here at [github.com/Isaac-Muscat/BabyMinecraft](https://github.com/Isaac-Muscat/BabyMinecraft).
