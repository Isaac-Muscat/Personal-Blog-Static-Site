## Introduction
I hope you are feeling awesome! I'm Isaac Muscat and thank you for stopping by at my portfolio site. This site is a place for me to present projects that I have worked on and document useful technical information in a blog format.

## Bio
I entered my first year in computer engineering at the University of Toronto in September of 2021, however, I was not interested in computers and engineering until I took physics from a great teacher in Grade 11 and started learning about programming (using Java). I find it astounding that computers and the internet allow people from around the world to learn and apply physics, math, computer science, and STEM with such a small barrier to entry and limitless possibilites.

In my free time I teach Karate and martial arts to children weekly at a local dojo that I have been attending for over 10 years and I am very grateful for the community. I also enjoy practicing and performaing jazz tenor saxophone at varous gigs with different bands. *(Some awsome early saxophonists are Charlie Parker, Sonny Stitt, and Sonny Rollins if you're curious)*.

I was inspired to make this blog from one of my friend's blog who loves graphics programming. You can visit his blog [here](https://loochisloo.ca/).

## Purpose of This Site
There is a massive amount of diverse and in-depth resources that are available for programming on the internet. However, I find that it is difficult to locate **succinct** information about these topics. As a result, I decided to create a repository of sorts that I and others may use as a reminder of how various technologies work. I also plan on posting information on a few other topics to mix it up a bit.
