## Inspiration
This is a project from when I was learning about 3D graphics for the first time while also learning about web development and the benefits of Typescript. The project was a sandbox to play with perlin noise, basic lighting, and 3D cameras.

## Features
* Uses canvas API to create geometry
* Basic camera system
* Basic scene system
* Ability to render arbitrary triangulated meshes
* Basic lighting
